PD-SOFL Tool User Guide
1. Brief introduction
PD-SOFL is a tool for the product derivation process based on feature models and formal specifications. Products are configured according to user needs to obtain specific products.

2. Functions
In our tool, the feature model of the specific product and the formal specification of the product family is used as input. The tool currently implements three main functions:
Integrating the formal specification of features;
Structuring all feature scenario paths;
Generating specific products automatically from feature model and feature specification.

PD-SOFL is currently in the development and perfection stage, and any interested scholars are welcome to share their experiences together.
